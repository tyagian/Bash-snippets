-- Basics --
SQL commands can be broken into roughly three categories: DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and DCL (Data Control Language).
DDL is a set of commands used to define the overall structure or schema of how your data is going to be stored. In other words, you would use DDL to create a table, update the fields in an existing table, or any other operation where you are changing the structure of how you store data, but not actually changing the data itself.
DML is a set of commands used to actually manipulate data stored in your database. This includes looking up records in your table, inserting new data into a table, deleting records, etc. This is where you will spend a large portion of your time when dealing with SQL, and can be further broken into roughly four main categories:

Retrieving data
Creating data
Updating data
Deleting data
DCL is a set of commands used to dictate which users have permissions to do different things inside of your database. For example you might set up a user so that it has permission to read data in your database but it doesn’t have permission to create new records.
